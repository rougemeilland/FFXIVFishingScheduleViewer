# About the strength of the tug

"!" (Exclamation mark) indicates the strength of the tug. It has the same meaning as what appears above the player character's head when catching a fish.
  -  "!" means light tug.
  -  "!!" means medium tug.
  -  "!!!" means big tug.

# How to catch the fish

How to fish is written as follows.
```
<name of fishing bait>
    ⇒ (<exclamation points>)<fish name>
```
For example, if it is written as "Fistful of northern krill ⇒ (!!) Rock Lobster", replace it as follows.
```
Do Cast using fistful of northern krill as fishing bait.
If there is a strong quake, you can (or may) fish a rock lobster
```
Similarly, in the case of mooching, it is written as follows.
```
<name of fishing bait>
    ⇒ (<exclamation points>)<fish name>
    ⇒ (<exclamation points>)<fish name>
```
For example, if it is written as "Pill bug⇒(!!) Harbor Herring HQ⇒(!!!) Octmammoth)", replace it as follows.
```
Do Cast using pill bug as fishing bait.
And if there is medium tug, you can (or may) fish the harbor herring HQ. And If you can catch it, do Mooch.
And if there is big tug, you can (or may) fish the octmammoth
```

# Hooksets to use

The following hooksets are the default hooksets used with Patience.

  - Do Precision Hookset if the strength if the tug is "!" (light tug)
  - Do Powerful Hookset if the strength if the tug is "!!" (mediumt tug)
  - Do Powerful Hookset if the strength if the tug is "!!!" (big tug)

For fish where the default hookset is inappropriate, the note will indicate the appropriate hookset for that fish.

For example, if the note says `Pill bug ⇒ (!!! Precision Hoookset) Goldenfin`,
it is appropriate to use Precision Hookset instead of Powerful Hookset.
